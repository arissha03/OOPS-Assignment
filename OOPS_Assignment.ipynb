        "Ans :-** The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python are :-.\n",
        "        \"1.  **Class:** Class is defined as a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have. For example, a Car class might have attributes like color and model, and methods like start() and stop().\n",
        "    .\n",
        "        \"2.  **Object:** Objects are an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object is created from it. Objects hold the actual data and the functionality that is defined in the class..\n",
        "    .\n",
        "        \"3.  **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is the practice of hiding the internal state and functionality of an object and only exposing a limited interface. In Python, encapsulation is achieved through access modifiers like public, private, and protected attributes or methods (e.g., prefixing with underscores).\n",
        "    .\n",
        "        \"4.  **Inheritance:** It is a mechanism for creating a new class that reuses, extends, or modifies the behavior of an existing class. The new class (called a child or subclass) inherits the properties and methods of the parent class..\n",
        "    .\n",
        "        \"5.  **Polymorphism:** The ability to use a common interface for different data types. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class. In Python, this is often used with method overriding and operator overloading..\n",
        "    .\n",
        "        \"These core concepts help in designing flexible, reusable, and organized code using OOP principles.\"\n",

        "Method Resolution Order (MRO) is a mechanism in Python that determines the order in which base classes are searched when calling a method on an object. This is especially important in the context of multiple inheritance, where a class may inherit from multiple parents, and it needs to resolve which method to call.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to compute the MRO. This ensures a consistent and predictable method resolution order, taking into account the order of inheritance and the order of classes in the hierarchy.\n",

        "How MRO Works\n",
        "Single Inheritance: The MRO is straightforward; it follows the single superclass chain.\n",

        "Diamond Problem in Multiple Inheritance\n",
        "The Diamond Problem occurs in object-oriented programming languages that support multiple inheritance, where a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a common superclass. This creates a \"diamond\" shape in the class hierarchy. The problem arises when a method or attribute is called on the derived class that is defined in the common superclass, leading to ambiguity about which inherited method or attribute to use.\n",
        "How Python Resolves the Diamond Problem\n",
        "Python uses the C3 Linearization algorithm (also known as C3 superclass linearization) to resolve the Diamond Problem. This algorithm provides a consistent method resolution order (MRO) that determines the order in which base classes are looked up for methods and attributes.\n",
